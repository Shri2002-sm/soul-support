      <h1>WHO WE ARE</h1>
      <p>
        As a team, we are very excited about our new project: a social media
        platform designed specifically for mental health support. With the rise
        of social media usage and its impact on mental health, we believe that
        creating a platform that prioritizes mental health and well-being is
        crucial. We believe that mental health is an essential part of overall
        health and wellbeing, and it should be given the same importance as
        physical health. Through our platform, we hope to break down the stigma
        surrounding mental health by providing a supportive and inclusive
        community. We are thrilled to see the impact our platform can have on
        individuals' mental health and wellbeing, and we invite everyone to join
        us on this journey. Together, we can create a world where mental health
        is given the importance it deserves, and individuals feel supported and
        connected.
